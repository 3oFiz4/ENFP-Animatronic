# ENFP-Animatronic (UNFINISHED) 🤖
Yo, what's good? Welcome to the home of the most chaotic, fun-loving Discord bot out there, designed exclusively for our squad of ENFPs. 🎉

This bot is all about bringing the party to our server with minigames, surprises, and a whole lot more. It's like having a virtual party animal right in your chat! 🎮🎈

Here's what we're cooking up:

- [ ] Prep Time: Getting all our ducks in a row before the real fun begins. 🦆
- [ ] The Big Idea: Brainstorming all the wild things this bot will be able to do. 💡
- [ ] File Structure: Organizing our bot's brain so it can keep up with us. 🗂️
- [ ] Commands: The magic words to make our bot do its thing. 🗣️

Stay tuned, it's about to get lit! 🔥"!
